# leaflet-challenge-1
Module 15 Challenge
I created a New Repository for this project called leaflet-challenge-1, I cloned the repository to this computer. I created a directory for the Leaflet Challenge. I made two folders - Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2. I added the HTML and Javascript files to the repository. I pushed the changes to Github. I created the Earthquake Visualization and gathered and plotted more data. I visualized the earthquake dataset. I visualized the Earthquake hazards program. I impported and visulaized the data, using Leaflet I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on longitude and latitude. I also included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker was clicked. I created a legend that will provide context for the map data. For Part 2, I plotted a second data set to illsutarte the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. I pulled in the dataset - https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates and visualized it alongside my original data. I plotted the tectonic plates dataset on the map in addition to the earthquakes. I added other base maps, I put eash dataset into separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently. I added layer controls to the map.
